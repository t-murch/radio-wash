End-to-End Authentication FlowHere is a detailed breakdown of the entire process, showing how the user, your Next.js frontend, your .NET backend, and Spotify all interact.Phase 1: Initiating Login (User's Browser)This phase starts when the user decides to log in.User Clicks Login: On your Next.js login page (app/page.tsx or similar), the user clicks the "Connect with Spotify" button.Navigate to Backend: The login function from your useAuth hook is called. It executes window.location.href = '/api/auth/login'. This directly navigates the user's browser to your .NET backend's login endpoint.Backend Redirects to Spotify: Your .NET AuthController receives the request at the [HttpGet("login")] endpoint.It generates a unique state parameter for security.It calls _authService.GenerateAuthUrl(state) to get the special login URL for Spotify.It issues an HTTP 302 Redirect, telling the user's browser to go to that Spotify URL.Phase 2: Spotify AuthenticationThe user is now interacting exclusively with Spotify.User Consents: The user sees the Spotify login and consent screen. They enter their credentials and approve your application's request for permissions.Spotify Redirects to Backend: Once approved, Spotify redirects the user's browser back to the redirect_uri you configured. This URI points to your .NET Backend's callback endpoint: /api/auth/callback. Spotify includes the code and the state from the previous step as query parameters.Phase 3: The Backend Callback (Secure Token Exchange)This is the first callback, and its purpose is purely server-to-server security. The user's browser is just the messenger.Backend Receives Code: Your .NET AuthController receives the request at the [HttpGet("callback")] endpoint.Backend Validates and Exchanges:It first validates the state parameter to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.It securely exchanges the code with Spotify for an access_token and refresh_token. This must be done on the backend because it requires your client secret, which should never be exposed to the frontend.It uses the access_token to fetch the user's profile from Spotify.It finds the user in your database or creates a new one (GetOrCreateUserAsync).It generates its own JWT (AuthResponse.Token) that contains the user's ID from your database.Backend Sets Cookie and Redirects:Instead of sending the token in a JSON response, it creates a secure, HttpOnly cookie named rw-auth-token and attaches it to the response.It then issues another HTTP 302 Redirect, this time sending the user's browser to your Next.js Frontend's callback page: /auth/callback.Phase 4: The Frontend Callback (UI/State Update)This is the second callback, and its purpose is to update the application state now that the browser has the session cookie.Frontend Page Loads: The user's browser, now holding the rw-auth-token cookie, loads your Next.js page at app/auth/callback/page.tsx.Client-Side Logic Runs:The useEffect hook in this component triggers.It calls queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['me'] }). This tells React Query that any cached data for the "me" query is stale.React Query automatically refetches the data by calling the getMe function.Authenticated API Call: The getMe function makes a fetch request to your backend's /api/auth/me endpoint. Because credentials: 'include' is set, the browser automatically attaches the rw-auth-token cookie to this request.Backend Verifies User: The .NET [Authorize] attribute on the Me() action inspects the cookie, validates the JWT, and confirms the user is logged in. It then retrieves the user's data and sends it back as JSON.State is Updated and Final Redirect:React Query receives the user data and updates the global application state. The useAuth() hook now reports isAuthenticated: true with the user's details.The invalidateQueries promise resolves, and the .then() block executes router.push('/dashboard'). The user is now fully logged in and on their dashboard.This two-callback system cleanly separates concerns: the backend handles all secret keys and token exchanges, while the frontend handles updating its own state and UI in response to the session being created.
