## Technical Debt & Quality Issues

### **Security Concerns**
- ✅ **Token Encryption**: Properly implemented with Data Protection API
- ✅ **Authentication**: Supabase JWT validation working
- ❌ **Rate Limiting**: Not implemented per specification
- ❌ **Input Validation**: Basic but needs comprehensive validation
- ❌ **GDPR Compliance**: No data export/deletion features

### **Performance & Scalability**
- ✅ **Database Indexing**: Basic indexes in place
- ❌ **Caching Strategy**: No Redis or memory caching implemented
- ❌ **API Rate Limiting**: Missing rate limiting for external APIs
- ❌ **Queue Management**: Single queue, no priority queues

### **Testing Coverage**
- ✅ **Test Infrastructure**: Comprehensive test setup with Vitest/Playwright
- ✅ **Unit Tests**: Good coverage for services and controllers
- ✅ **Integration Tests**: Database and API integration tests
- ❌ **E2E Tests**: Limited end-to-end workflow coverage

## Architecture Alignment Analysis

### **Clean Architecture Compliance**
The current implementation partially follows Clean Architecture:
- ✅ **Separation of Concerns**: Services, controllers, and data access properly separated
- ✅ **Dependency Injection**: Proper DI container setup
- ❌ **Domain Layer**: Missing proper domain entities and value objects
- ❌ **Application Layer**: Commands/Queries pattern not implemented

### **Database Design**
- ✅ **Entity Relationships**: Proper foreign key relationships
- ❌ **Schema Mismatch**: Current schema differs significantly from specification
- ❌ **Missing Entities**: Key entities like `Playlist`, `Track` not implemented
- ❌ **Audit Trail**: No created/updated timestamp consistency

## Implementation Priority Roadmap

   - Payment processing
   - Subscription management
   - Webhook handling

2. **Subscription Features**
   - Gated functionality
   - Usage tracking
   - Billing UI

### **Phase 3: Advanced Features (4-6 weeks)**
1. **Public Playlist Sync**
   - Popular playlist discovery
   - Automated sync jobs
   - Subscriber-only features

2. **Performance & Scalability**

   - Deployment automation

## Risk Assessment

### **High Risk**
- **Complex Integration**: Apple Music API integration complexity unknown
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe integration requires careful testing
- **Scalability**: Current job processing may not scale under load

### **Medium Risk**
- **Data Migration**: Significant schema changes needed
- **Testing Coverage**: E2E testing needs expansion
- **Rate Limiting**: External API rate limits need careful management

### **Low Risk**
- **Frontend Development**: React/Next.js implementation straightforward
- **Authentication**: Supabase integration working well
- **Basic Features**: Core playlist washing functionality mostly complete

## Conclusion

The RadioWash implementation has established a solid foundation with approximately **35-40% completion** of the specification. The core playlist washing feature is functional but needs completion, and major components like subscription management and Apple Music integration are entirely missing.

**Estimated time to full specification compliance: 12-16 weeks** with a focused development team.

The current codebase demonstrates good engineering practices and architectural decisions, making it a strong foundation for completing the remaining features according to the technical specification.
