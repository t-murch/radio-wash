# Realtime Broadcasting Fix Integration Test

## Issue Summary
The `SupabaseRealtimeService` was experiencing "Unknown Error on Channel" issues due to:

1. **Race conditions**: No proper waiting for channel subscription completion
2. **Connection state**: Not verifying connection state before operations
3. **No timeout handling**: Operations could hang indefinitely
4. **Limited error information**: Generic exception handling hid specific realtime errors

## Fix Implementation

### Key Improvements:

1. **Connection State Validation**: Check if socket is connected before proceeding
2. **Proper Channel Subscription**: Wait for channel to reach `Joined` state before broadcasting
3. **Timeout Protection**: 5-second timeout on broadcast operations
4. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Specific handling for `RealtimeException` vs generic exceptions
5. **Input Validation**: Check for null/empty channel names

### Testing Strategy:

1. **Unit Tests**: Updated existing tests to match new signature
2. **Integration Test**: Test with actual Supabase instance
3. **Error Scenarios**: Verify graceful handling of network issues

## Expected Behavior After Fix:

- Channels will properly join before broadcasting
- Connection issues will be logged with detailed error information
- Broadcast operations will timeout gracefully instead of hanging
- Main playlist processing will continue even if realtime fails

## Verification Steps:

1. Run clean playlist job
2. Monitor logs for successful realtime broadcasts
3. Verify frontend receives progress updates
4. Check that processing completes even if realtime fails
